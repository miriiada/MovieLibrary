## Media Library
A personalized media library manager for local collections, designed for convenient cataloging and navigation of video and graphic novel content. The application is built with Python using the CustomTkinter graphical library.

## About The Project
This project was created as an alternative to existing media servers, with a focus on local use, high performance, and a flexible manual management system. The core idea is to provide the user with complete control over their collection, from posters to a unique tagging system, without depending on external online services.

## Key Features

## üìö Library Management
- **Add Content**: Simply point the application to a parent folder, and it will automatically scan all subdirectories, treating each one as a unique title.
- **Local Database**: All information about your collection is stored locally in a `data/library.db` file (SQLite), ensuring privacy and fast access.
- **Automatic Content-Type Detection**: The application automatically analyzes a folder's contents and assigns it a type:
- `video`: For standard folders containing video files.
- `gallery`: For folders with a large number of images (e.g., manga or comics), which prevents loading a list of thousands of files to maintain performance.
- **Manual Type Override**: You can always manually change the content type for any title through the UI.
  
## üñºÔ∏è Visual Presentation
- **Dual View Modes**: Switch between a classic vertical list view and a visually-oriented grid view with posters.
- **Custom Posters**: Easily add or change the poster for any title. The application copies your selected image to the local `data/posters` folder and links it to the title.
- **Details Panel**: Selecting a title displays an information panel on the right, showing the large poster, full title, content type, a list of tags, and a list of files (for video types).
  
## üè∑Ô∏è Advanced Tagging System
- **Global Tag Management**: A dedicated "Manage Tags" window allows you to create, rename (case-sensitively), and delete tags from the entire system.
- **Title-Specific Tag Editor**: A user-friendly editor lets you quickly assign and unassign tags for a specific title by selecting from the global list.
- **Filter by Tags**: A powerful filtering system in the sidebar allows you to display only the titles that contain all of the tags you have selected.
  
## ‚ú® User Experience (UX)
- **Copyable Titles**: Title text in both the main list and the details card can be easily selected and copied (Ctrl+C), simplifying manual searches for information online.
- **Persistent Selection Highlight**: The currently selected title remains highlighted with a distinct color, so you never lose track of it.
- **Hover Preview (Tooltip)**: Hover your mouse over any title in the list for a moment, and a small pop-up card will appear with its poster and tags for a quick preview.
- **Quick File Access**:
- **Middle-clicking** on a title opens its folder in the system's file explorer.
- **Left-clicking** on a file in the details card plays it in your default media player.
  
## Installation and Setup
The project is written in Python and requires a few libraries to be installed.

**1. Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10+

**2. Creating a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

```bash
# Create a folder for the environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Installing Dependencies:
Install the required libraries using pip.

```bash
pip install customtkinter
pip install Pillow
```

## 4. Running the Application:
After installation, simply run the main file.

```bash
python main.py
```
On the first launch, the application will automatically create a `data` directory containing the `library.db` database file and a `posters` folder.

## Project Structure
```bash
